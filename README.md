# BFD-ECP

This repository contains BFD pseudopotentials and corresponding basis sets.

These pseudopotentials are scalar-relativistic energy-consistent Hartree-Fock
pseudopotentials, which do not exhibit a singularity at the nucleus and are
specifically constructed for the use in quantum Monte Carlo calculations -
although they can of course be used for other approaches as well. Their
performance is discussed in detail in the papers below.

If you use these pseudopotentials, please cite the references below. A bibtex
file is provided in this repository.
